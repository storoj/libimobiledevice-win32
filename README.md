# libimobiledevice-win32
win32 port of libimobiledevice (http://libimobiledevice.org)

the original project can not complie the Release version . So I modify the settings to adapt it to the Release Version.
but it still has some complie error need to be done.( these errors show event in the Debug mode)

Besides ,I add the plistutils into the project so that you can use it to decode the binary plist file.
